Go to the directory where the build folder is.

cd /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/repo/depiction/GitLockPlus/mobileBuild/Build

run command

./mergeAll.sh


Takes all css files and combines it into one. Puts files in WebReady folder. Donâ€™t include font-awesome.

Also takes multiple javascript files and puts it in one, while compressing it. If any new javascript files are added, update the mergeALL script to include them.

If mobile.html is updated, it must be updated here.
